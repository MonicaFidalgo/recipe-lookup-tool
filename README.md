## **API Reference**

This project fetches data from the [MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).

## **Installation**

The backend is hosted using json-server on a local machine. To install and run json-server, see the [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

## How to Run
